Hotfix v1.2.5: Fix DELAY restart timing calculation

- Fixed DELAY restart to calculate from server startup time instead of last restart time
- Added serverStartTime tracking for accurate DELAY restart countdown
- Status command now shows correct time remaining for DELAY restarts
- Improved time calculation accuracy for all restart types

Bug fix:
- DELAY restart was incorrectly using lastRestartTime (time of previous restart)
- Now correctly uses serverStartTime (when server actually started)
- Status display now shows accurate countdown: "in 0h 1m (delay restart)"

Technical changes:
- Added serverStartTime field to RestartManager
- Updated getNextRestartInfo() to use correct time base for DELAY type
- Improved restart time calculation logic
